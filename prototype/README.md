# Prototype Files

This directory contains early prototype versions of the tmux-ssh tool before it was refactored into a proper Python package.

## Usage

```bash
python3 tmux_ssh.py [arguments]
```

## Note

These files are kept for reference only. For the current implementation, use the packaged version:

```bash
pip install -e .
tmux-ssh [arguments]
```
